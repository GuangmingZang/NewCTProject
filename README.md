Basically, in this project,
- We are interested and investigating in CBCT (come beam computed tomography) reconstruction problems and methods. 
- We derive the proximal oparator of [SART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_Algebraic_Reconstruction_Technique) (Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique) algorithm
- We are trying to demonstrate the proposed methods in our PrixiSART framework, including PSART-Structure Tensor prior, PSART-SAD prior, and PSART-TV,  could cope with super resolution reconstruction,we compare our framework to stateof-the-art methods and existing popular software tomographyreconstruction packages, on both synthetic and real datasets, and show superior reconstruction quality

This is quite interesting project, and any suggestion or comment is appreciated!
